    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        brief: >

      - id: id
        type: string
        brief: >
          Container ID. Usually a UUID, as for example used to
          [identify Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#container-identification).
          The UUID might be abbreviated.
        examples: ['a3bf90e006b2']
      - id: runtime
        type: string
        brief: >
          The container runtime managing this container.
        examples: ['docker', 'containerd', 'rkt']
      - id: image.name
        type: string
        brief: >
          Name of the image the container was built on.
        examples: ['gcr.io/opentelemetry/operator']
      - id: image.tag
        type: string
        brief: >
          Container image tag.
        examples: ['0.1']
      - id: image.id
        type: string
        brief: >
          The ID of the container image. Usually a hash algorithm followed by a UUID. The UUID might be abbreviated.
        examples: ['sha256:f90d814248a0']
      - id: command
        type: string
        brief: >
          The command used to run the container (i.e. the command name).
        examples: [ 'otelcontribcol' ]
      - id: command_line
        type: string
        brief: >
          The full command run by the container as a single string representing the full command.
          It is recommended to remove embedded credentials or sensitive data to prevent potential leakage.
        examples: [ 'otelcontribcol --config config.yaml' ]
      - id: command_args
        type: string[]
        brief: >
          All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) run by the container.
